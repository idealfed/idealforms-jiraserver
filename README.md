This repository contains an Atlassian JIRA plugin that implements EXTJS 6 GPL for use within the JIRA system.

The plugin runs as a servlet on the JIRA Tomcat instance and the plugin uses the JIRA API for it's communications.

Forms configuration and management works similarly to Microsoft Access "Forms".  The concept is the JIRA Project becomes the datastore and data model and one uses the EXTJS forms to create custom user interfaces.

Using this package you can effectively customize most any workflow automation.
